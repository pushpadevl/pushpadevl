# I'm Pushpendra Pal

I'm a freelance **cryptography researcher** specializing in **applied cryptography**, especially in the areas of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs)** and **SNARKs**. My work focuses on building robust, real-world cryptographic solutions and sharing knowledge through open-source projects.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Circom
- Rust
- Bash
- Java
- C
- Docker
- snarkjs
- VSCode
- LaTeX

## 🚀 Featured Projects
Some of my best and most impactful projects:
- **[Shamir Secret Sharing](https://crates.io/crates/shamir_secret_sharing)** (published on crates.io): A Rust implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme.
- **Circom Proof for Secret Sharing:** ZK circuit for secret sharing using circom and snarkjs.
- **DIF FFT:** Fast Fourier Transform algorithms for cryptographic applications.
- **CP Algorithms:** Cryptographic primitives and algorithms implemented for research and education.
- **Crytex-ISI Kolkata:** Research and codebase associated with the ISI Kolkata cryptography group.
