# I'm Pushpendra

I'm a freelance **cryptography researcher** specializing in **applied cryptography**, especially in the areas of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK proofs)** and **SNARKs**. My work focuses on building robust, real-world cryptographic solutions and sharing knowledge through open-source projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- Circom circuit design
- Rust
- Bash
- Java
- C
- Docker 
- snarkjs (Circom proofs)
- Web development (JS, CSS, HTML)
- LaTeX

## üöÄ Featured Projects
Some of my best and most impactful projects:
- **[Shamir Secret Sharing](https://crates.io/crates/shamir_secret_sharing)** (published on crates.io): A Rust implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme.
- **Verifiable Secret sharing using circoms
- **BGW Multi party computation protocol** implementation in rust for fixed circuits, working on the circuit adaptability for arbitrary circuits. 
- **Circom Proof for Secret Sharing:** ZK circuit for secret sharing using circom and snarkjs.
- **DIF FFT:** Fast Fourier Transform algorithms for cryptographic applications for use in zk snark proof generation.
- **CP Algorithms:** Cryptographic primitives and algorithms implemented for research and education.
- **Crytex-ISI Kolkata:** Cryptology hackathon, focused on modified mathematical puzzles, group theory and historical ciphers, created by me along with associates from ISI Kolkata.
